The deployed web application can be viewed [HERE](https://as-portfolio-react.herokuapp.com/).<br>

The images below show the new React portfolio page design and highlights to some of the new features that have been added:<br>

The Home section shows the redesigned layout featuring the same theme and background image of the previous version of the portfolio. It includes a brief introductory statement and social network links. The page works the same as before with scrolling and navigation, but each section has been redesigned and a Resume section added.<br>

Clicking the About button in the navbar scrolls down to display the About section with profile image and bio information. Note the About nav button color changes when it is the active selection. Included here is a 'Download Resume' button to download a PDF version of the LinkedIn resume.<br>

Clicking the Resume button in the navbar scrolls down to display the newly added Resume section. This section is divided into three subsections - Education, Work, and Skills. The Skills section includes the various web development technoligies and the level of proficiency with each.<br>
